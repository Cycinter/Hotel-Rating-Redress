# Hotel-Rating-Redress - Review Sentiment Analysis
This project involved a collaborative sentiment analysis of hotel reviews, aiming to reduce subjectivity in different ratings by analyzing the semantic meaning of review texts. The goal was to standardize the scores for reviews with similar semantic content based on the text data from the database.

# My Contributions:
Focused on the Word2Vec implementation to represent review texts as vectors, improving the accuracy of sentiment classification.
Applied K-means clustering using Veka to group reviews with similar semantic patterns.
Studied and adapted a Kaggle sentiment analysis project (link), thoroughly researching each library and function to understand the implementation and improve my machine learning and NLP skills.

# Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience in NLP, Word2Vec, and clustering techniques.
Enhanced understanding of machine learning workflows and improved the consistency of hotel rating predictions through text-based sentiment analysis.
